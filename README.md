# Rabby-s-Computer-Gallery
A C++ project made for my university course named project 200
Made by: Faiyaz Ahmed Rabby 181-115-025 CSE 46th Batch Metropolitan University

Project Overview: Every time we need to buy any computer related products such as a laptop, desktop, keyboard, mouse etc. We have to visit the local shop and buy from there. There are a few shops who take orders through phone calls but they can't respond every time properly, which brings a big hassle. So, my motivation is to solve these problems with a proper app for the shopkeepers across the Sylhet.
Goals: By this project I would like to solve the ordering hassle through phone calls and special visiting physical shops to order.
Features: • Online Order	• Home Delivery	• Product Details
